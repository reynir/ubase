# Ubase

Ocaml library for removing diacritics (accents, etc.) from Latin
letters in UTF8 string.

It should work for all utf8 strings, regardless of normalization NFC,
NFD, NFKD, NFKC.

__Please__ don't use this library to store your strings without
accents! On the contrary, store them in full UTF8 encoding, and use
this library to simplify searching and comparison.

## Example

```ocaml
let nfc = "V\197\169 Ng\225\187\141c Phan";; 
let nfd = "Vu\204\131 Ngo\204\163c Phan";;

print_endline nfc;; 
Vũ Ngọc Phan

print_endline nfd;; 
Vũ Ngọc Phan

Ubase.from_utf8 nfc;;
- : string = "Vu Ngoc Phan"

Ubase.from_utf8 nfd;; 
- : string = "Vu Ngoc Phan"
```

## Usage

```ocaml
val from_utf8 : ?malformed:string -> ?strip:string -> string -> string
(** Remove all diacritics on latin letters from a standard string containing
    UTF8 text. Any malformed UTF8 will be replaced by the [malformed] parameter
    (by default "?"). If the optional parameter [strip] is present, all
    non-ascii, non-latin unicode characters will be replaced by the [strip]
    string (which can be empty). *)
```
	
## Install

Ubase depends (only) on `uutf`.

Download the repository, move into the `ubase` directory, and

```
dune build
opam install .
```

## Testing

From the `ubase` directory:

```
dune utop
```

## From the command line

Once you have installed the library, you can execute the `ubase`
program from a terminal

```
$ ubase Déjà vu !
Deja vu !

$ ubase "et grønt træ"
et gront trae
```

(Notice that the quotes "" are not required)

## Doc

Documentation and API are available
[here](https://sanette.github.io/ubase/docs).

Manually building the docs, from the `ubase` directory:

```
dune build @doc
firefox ./_build/default/_doc/_html/ubase/Ubase/index.html
```

## Using Ubase for accent-insensitive searching

Have a look at [Ufind](https://github.com/sanette/ufind), a small
search engine based on Ubase.
